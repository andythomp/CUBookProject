This was our giant group project for what has been coined by professors as "the flagship course of our program" and known as the "deathmarch course" by other students. 

The project consists of a client and server architecture. The server is threadpooled, and handles messages sent as per class specified protocol. The server utilizes an SQL database for clients. As per specifications, the server requires no authentication.

The server pushes updates and messages out to clients, the clients process and show the messages. The client updates the server as necessary when the user interacts with it.

Ultimately the application is a sort of interactive forum. Users can sign up for courses and then post messages to those course forums. Professors can log in and interact with their students. 

All three deliverables involved sleepless nights, and for our final deliverable which was the majority of the coding it included multiple sleepless nights. Looking back on the whole project with the knowledge I've gained now, I don't think it was as difficult as we made it out to be, but given our project was top of our class (110/100 on a sliding scale marking scheme) we did pretty good for what we knew back then.

For anyone interested, the deliverables are in pdf form in the root folder, and the client and server are in seperate folders. Client and Server were made in QT, and require QT installed in ubuntu to run. Due to the nature of QT, it should work in windows but it has not been tested.
